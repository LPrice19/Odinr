    <h1> Smash Burgers </h1>

    <img src="burger.webp"> 

    <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers 
        with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner 
        than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold.
        I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen.
        These grill up very fast because of the high heat,
        so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
            <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate</li>
            <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls</li>
            <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark.</li>
        </ol>
